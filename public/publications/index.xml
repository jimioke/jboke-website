      <title>Where is my Infusion Pump? Harnessing Network Dynamics for Improved Hospital Equipment Fleet Management</title>
      <link>https://people.umass.edu/jboke/publications/martinez2020where/</link>

      <description>Background: Timely availability of infusion pumps is critical for delivering high-quality patient care. However, pumps are a shared asset among hospital units without central management of their distribution. We performed a quantitative analysis of the extent of unit-to-unit sharing and its impact on shortages, and developed a system to increase availability throughout the hospital.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 3,832 pumps moving in a densely interconnected network of 5,292 radio frequency and infrared sensors from January to November 2017 at a tertiary care center in Baltimore, Maryland.</description>
