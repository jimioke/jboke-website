## Synopsis
The unique environments of urban agglomerations have given rise to interesting problems and opportunities for development on a scale that requires innovative approaches and new ways of thinking. Chief among these concerns are energy and water consumption, climate change, mobility and accessibility. Rapid developments in information technology, big data analytics, sharing platforms and automation have increased the uncertainty in future urban outcomes, while raising ever more complex challenges of integration and planning in order to ensure equitable and sustainable societies. Given that over 60% of the world's population is expected to be urbanized by 2050, there is growing urgency toward addressing these problems using solutions that are readily transferable and globally relevant. My academic career goal is to combine techniques from data analytics and visualization, optimization and simulation to economics and urban planning in order to uncover critical information, create interdisciplinary tools and evaluate public policy decisions towards the realization of desirable outcomes for the world's cities and regions.
