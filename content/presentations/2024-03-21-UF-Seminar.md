### Abstract
Our critical infrastructure systems, especially public transportation, are in urgent need of decision-making and planning frameworks to address multiple challenges arising from disruptive events, climate change mitigation and shrinking revenues. In this talk, I will discuss how supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) approaches can enhance these frameworks in order to provide deeper insights into transit and road networks at various scales. First, I will present a system-wide ML model to predict line-specific rail transit energy at hourly and daily scales in order to support planning decisions, along with a current extension toward mapping planning metrics to low-level movement variables via deep learning in order to forecast energy from specific plans. Next, I will present our work on a typology-enhanced trip chaining algorithm for originâ€“destination estimation in a bus network, where we demonstrate how ML enhancements significantly improve performance. Finally, I will briefly discuss other relevant efforts highlighting the potential of ML paradigms to provide insights into the impact of road network structure on congestion and the transition towards zero-emissions transit.
