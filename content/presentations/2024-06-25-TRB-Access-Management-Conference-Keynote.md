### Abstract
The unique environments of both rural and urban agglomerations have given rise to interesting problems and opportunities for development on a scale that requires innovative approaches and new ways of thinking. Chief among these concerns are climate change, mobility and accessibility. Rapid developments in information technology, big data analytics, sharing platforms and automation have increased the uncertainty in future urban outcomes, while raising ever more complex challenges of integration and planning in order to ensure equitable and sustainable societies. Given that over 60% of the worldâ€™s population is expected to be urbanized by 2050, there is a growing urgency to address these problems using solutions that are readily transferable and globally relevant. I will present recent work exploring an urban typology spanning over 300 global cities and implications for sustainable mobility planning. I will also discuss relevant safety, electrification and environmental implications from ongoing case studies, considering equity and resilience impacts.
