**Background:** Timely availability of infusion pumps is critical for delivering high-quality patient care. However, pumps are a shared asset among hospital units without central management of their distribution. We performed a quantitative analysis of the extent of unit-to-unit sharing and its impact on shortages, and developed a system to increase availability throughout the hospital.

**Methods:** We performed a retrospective study of 3,832 pumps moving in a densely interconnected network of 5,292 radio frequency and infrared sensors from January to November 2017 at a tertiary care center in Baltimore, Maryland. We used longitudinal statistical models to determine whether pump inventory in one unit was associated with inventory fluctuations in others, and used a quasi-experimental design and segmented regression to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed inventory system.

**Results:** During the study period, 93 distinct units were connected via 67,111 pump transactions. Discernible clusters of pump sharing were present. Up to 17% (95% CI 7-27%) of a unitâ€™s pump inventory was explained by the inventory level of other units within its cluster. These effects were not seen among neighbors in the immediate geographic location, not attributable to units in the same department, nor exclusively driven by bed occupancy fluctuations. Design and deployment of a hospital-wide inventory balancing system resulted in a 44% (95% CI 36-53%) increase in the number of units above safety inventory levels.

**Conclusion:** Network phenomena are important inputs to infusion pump fleet management; consequently, benefits of improved inventory management in one unit may spread throughout the hospital.
